# Obtaining the software

The authoritative location of the software is the following git repository: <http://mpegx.int-evry.fr/software/MPEG/dmc/TM/mpeg-vmesh-tm>

Each released version may be identified by a version control system tag in the form: `v2.0`

An example:

```console
$ git clone \
   http://mpegx.int-evry.fr/software/MPEG/dmc/TM/mpeg-vmesh-tm.git
$ cd mpeg-vmesh-tm
$ git checkout v2.0
```

> It is strongly advised to obtain the software using the version control
> system rather than to download a zip (or other archive) of a particular
> release.  The build system uses the version control system to accurately
> identify the version being built.
